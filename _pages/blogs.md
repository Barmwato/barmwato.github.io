Welcome to my blog! Here you’ll find posts about IT support, cybersecurity, labs, and more.

In today’s digital world, data breaches happen far more often than most people realize. Major platforms — from social media sites to email providers — have suffered **data leaks**, exposing **millions of usernames and passwords** to hackers and the dark web.

If you reuse passwords or haven’t changed them in a while, there’s a chance your **credentials have already been leaked**.

- Steal personal information
